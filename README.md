## Advent of Code Day 1 and Day 4
Puzzles solved using programming. AoC1 involves pruning string inputs to determine digits and applying a specific algorithm to combine them into a sum per line. AoC4 involves splitting input into two lists of numbers and comparing their contents, with a prize pool increasing based on the results per line. `aoc_puzzle_input_4.txt` is the puzzle input for Advent of Code Day 4.
